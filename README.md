# FriendFinder
### Friend Finder is a simple match-making application

To run this app on your machine, follow these instructions: 

1. Git Clone this repository
2. Use **npm install** to download all required node_modules

Client-side, this application will ask the user to fill out a 10-question survey, and then return a suitable 'friend' match, based on other users' answers who have filled out this same survey.
