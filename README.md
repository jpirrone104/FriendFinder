# FriendFinder
### Friend Finder is a simple match-making application

To run this app on your machine, follow these instructions: 

1. Git Clone this repository
2. Use **npm install** to download all required node_modules

Client-side, this application will ask the user to fill out a 10-question survey, and then return a suitable 'friend' match, based on other users' answers who have filled out this same survey. 

At the time of this writing, *this application DOES NOT YET WORK* The submit button returns a 404 error to the console, as it is unable to locate and post the JSON to api/friends. I am working on finding a solution, but I ran out of time before I could submit. 

To come for this application: 

-Enhanced look and feel using a CSS template
-Questions that illustrate a theme
